Few Tips to improve performance of Stored Procedure in SQL Server
Use SET NOCOUNT ON as first statement of your stored procedure.
Prefer fully qualified name while executing the stored procedure like EXEC dbo.<procedurename>
Do not use sp_<procedurename> as "sp_" is a reserved keyword.
Prefer sp_execuresql over EXECUTE command.
Use SCHEMA name before the table name like dbo.<tablename>
Fetch only required columns is SELECT queries. Do not use SELECT *
Use WITH (NOLOCK)
Avoid using CURSOR.
Prefer table variable instead of temp table.
Transfer the relevant records from the tables to the table variable to disconnect primary table references.
Prefer tables JOINs over the use of subqueries in WHERE clause.
Avoid Costly operators (LIKE, NOT LIKE) and implicit/ explicit operators (CAST(), CONVERT(), GETDATE()) in WHERE clause.
Create VIEWs for repeatedly used SELECT queries.
Break down large stored procedures into sub procedures.
Keep Transactions SHORT. This will help in avoiding locks and deadlocks.
Create Non-Clustered indexes, wherever necessary.
Use EXISTS instead of COUNT() in subqueries.
Avoid dynamic SQL queries.
Prefer to have custom paging logic when result-set contains many records.
